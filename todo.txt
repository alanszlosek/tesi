- proper handling of tabs
- implement knox using iterm
	- get ui nice, etc
	- then switch back to TESI when TESI is mature
- why less not process keypresses but vim does?
- fix color usage from child apps
- issue with margin at bottom right

- what should echo the keys types at the command line?
- terminals of larger size
	- env variables?
- character set mapping


DONE

- callback_invertColors() function for flipping colors on whole terminal
- look at libROTE for pty and shell invocation
	- posix_openpt is bi-directional, so it should work for my needs with one use and then grantpt(), etc.
	- try it again in fork_pty.c
- if find term in terminfo with more "pure and simple" software implementation, i'll switch to it
	- didn't exist ... so i wrote my own
- colors
- Ask vt100 if keeping state is necessary for emulators
	- VT102 because of a smaller, easier to parse sequence set
	- Need to do character code mappings for drawing character sets to linux (and other) terminals
