- when come out of top, terminal doesn't scroll up
	- it does when we auto scroll, but it scrolls 1 extra line
	- when top quits, it moves off the bottom of the screen and sends \r\n. i guess that's how it figures it can scroll. maybe i should check the top source.
- get less working
- get top working
- implement knox using iterm
	- get ui nice, etc
	- then switch back to TESI when TESI is mature
- fix color usage from child apps
- issue with margin at bottom right
- terminals of larger size
	- env variables?
- character set mapping


DONE

- proper handling of tabs
	- works when i send keyboard input up the pipe as i get it
- what should echo the keys typed at the command line?
	- the child program should be the one processing keyboard input and determining if it needs to echo the keys
- callback_invertColors() function for flipping colors on whole terminal
- look at libROTE for pty and shell invocation
	- posix_openpt is bi-directional, so it should work for my needs with one use and then grantpt(), etc.
	- try it again in fork_pty.c
- if find term in terminfo with more "pure and simple" software implementation, i'll switch to it
	- didn't exist ... so i wrote my own
- colors
- Ask vt100 if keeping state is necessary for emulators
	- VT102 because of a smaller, easier to parse sequence set
	- Need to do character code mappings for drawing character sets to linux (and other) terminals
