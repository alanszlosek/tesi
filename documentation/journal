We don't have job control by default, so maybe something's not quite right with our "current terminal process group id" (from the bash manual JOB CONTROL section).

Read and effective user ids? What the? Ah! It's just a temporary place to store the user id: http://en.allexperts.com/q/Unix-Linux-OS-1064/real-effective-user-id.htm

Looks like I need to make the forked process a session leader with setsid(). Not sure why the parent's session id and process group id values don't work.

Maybe this is why: when we create a TESI terminal, we're running on a new pty, which is separate from the old controlling terminal. Maybe bash sees that our new controlling terminal and the old session/process-group ids are incompatible. ?

Or rather: the forked process isn't a process group leader, so it can't perform job control. If its PID was the same as its process group id, it'd be able to do job control. So we have to use setsid() to make a new session and process group.

Also found this useful. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_group

Shit, now I'm trying to fix the arrow keys. Looking for curses constants, and converting them to strings TESI expects. But that's not working. Maybe I need to think about it with bash in the equation. I have to once-again research all the steps involved in processing keyboard input. Fuck.

Thinking about it now, input from my keyboard goes through this process with TESI:

My main keyboard loop controlled by ncurses -> translated and written to input pipe for tesi child -> goes to bash -> bash interprets the key and updates the display if necessary. So, I don't need to do translation at all. Bash should be doing that.

So I turned ncurses scrolling off in main.c, and top works inside tesi.

My test_suite/loop app was doing weird behavior because it was set to echo input back to the terminal. So tesi was getting the enter key twice:

* Once from the code contained in loop.c spitting out input from getch
* Once from the tty level logic echoing

Need to finish support for signaling. Actually, I'm not sure where it stands. If the child app attached to a tesi terminal closes, tesi should run a callback function. Control-C on a tesi terminal should pass that value to the app on the other end.

It also appears I'm off by one somewhere. Top runs, but the last line isn't quite what it should be.

It'd be nice to have a test "echo" app that prints all input. Control-C to kill it. That'd make for a good test of limitCursor and give me a real show of whether we can reach the boundaries with text output.

What about smart logic that processes a string of output at a time? Only call moveCursor when done processing the output? Might be more difficult than it sounds, and also a prematur optimization?

Had a realization. I don't think TESI should be in charge of scrolling up the screen if the cursor moves beyond that bottom. Same with going off the side. It shouldn't make corrections for bad coordinates. It should simply prevent the move.

Scrolling. Needs a bit more thought. Probably should detect the need for scrolling differently than in limitCursor.
	- Pressing enter on last line of terminal should move cursor to 0, then invoke a scroll.

Need sequence for setting terminal title (like xterm).

- ccc capability? - can redefine existing colors
- km - has meta key?
- pairs#64
- cr - carriage return
- el means clear to eol, not erase line
- kent - key enter
- when enter characters to end of line, moves line to left and starts cursor half way... what's doing this?
- kbs - backspace?

could less be mis-behaving because of termios buffering?

Less prints to the screen starting at the last line of the terminal. And for some reason it's not processing my keypresses. Have to hit q twice to get it to quit.

- TESI reset sequence should set defaults
	- scroll region
	- output attributes
	- cursor position

man console_codes
man charsets
stty -a for cols/rows

Input

1. User presses key
2. Keyboard generates one or more scancodes which are received by the kernel
3. What is passed to the the terminal driver?
	a. If keyboard driver is in scan mode, they are passed to the application
	b. In keycode mode, key presses correspond to key press or release events
	c. Otherwise keycodes are looked up in the keymap, translated and passed along

Easiest thing would be to be able to use the keymap values to check for the pressed key and then to turn this back into what the application expects, depending on the tty io settings (scanmode, keymaps, keycodes, etc). However, ncurses and slang (i think) can only map one way.

Biggest Blunder Yet

Somehow I thought the first parameter of the move cursor sequence was the column number. It's not. It's the line number. Amazing the difference it makes.

There are too many operations available for old terminals. Since we're only dealing with software now, most are not necessary anymore.

Pointer Blunders

The transition from the "old way" of doing a certain piece of logic to the "new way" seems to always leave lingering bugs. In a few places I was still passing pointer to my tesi object, when I should have been passing the tesi object's pointer member.
