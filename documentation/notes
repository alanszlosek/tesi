NCURSES

QUESTIONS

- does a terminfo definition really need to specify the string sent to the terminal for newline, carriage return, backspace, enter, etc?
	- shouldn't this be chosen according to the character set and locale?
- can/should termios be used on pty FDs from posix_openpt()?
- how deal with unicode characters?
- time taken for initscr(), Tesi vs. Xterm
- does iterm buffer input up to EOL, end of input or next sequence?
